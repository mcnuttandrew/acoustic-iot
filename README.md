Developing Secure IoT triggering mechnisms via Acoustics Triggers üëè. This repo will contain information, code and a kick-ass publication for our amazing Idea!


## Scenario
Mobile processor benchmarking under battery load, a researcher needed to find a method to automatically disconnect phones from chargers prior to benchmarking in an automated fashion. To her dismay, off-the-shelf IoT smart-plug solutions are insecure and do not expose an documented API for DIYers. On the other hand, the undocumented internal API is completely exposed; the cheap IoT smart plugs work over insecure HTTP in plain text to accept commands. USB power relays, on the otherhand offer a solution but are not off-the-shelf and are pretty dangerous to set up for inexperienced users.

The solution? [The Clapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clapper). 

## Extensions
Since we are effectively proposing an Acoustic Transistor, we believe that we can group clappers into logic gates and higher level units until we get microprocess. The proposed processor speed will be measured in Beats per Minute (BPM). We expect the processor to produce a sick beat while executing tight computational flows.
